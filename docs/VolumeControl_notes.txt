"A good circuit can be ruined by bad layout (hence the differences in sounds between 
so many CD players) but ours is neat and very elegant with extremely short signal 
path routings. Switching is by reed relay and volume by motorised Alps, an arrangement 
that has dramatic advantages over most solid-state alternatives."

This statement would mean that an Apls 4-6VDC motorised potentiometers is used.

The data sheets I have found for these devices specifies the range of movement as 300°
and the rate of movement to be 12° per second with a 4.5 volt drive.
