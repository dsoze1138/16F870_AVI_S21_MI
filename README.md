16F870 FPC for AVI S21 MI audio amplifier
================================

This is reverse engineered code for the Front Panel Controller in the Audio Visual International Lab S21 MI audio amplifier.

The project was started as an attempt to help a user on the EDA board forum.

See this topic : https://www.edaboard.com/threads/pic16f870-help-please.398532/

At present this is a work in progress.

 What is implemented is just enough to select an audio source, turn mute on and off and turn record on and off.

In the fullness of time we may implement the decoding for infrared transmitter using the Philips  RC5 protocol supported by the original.
